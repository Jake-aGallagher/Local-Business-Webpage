### created using react

#### Other Dependancies:
* react-google-maps/api
* react-spring/parallax
* react-router


#### Purpose of this app
The purpose of this app was to create a large 'multi-page' single page application, closely coppying the style of a small local business, the webpage needed to be appealing to the eye and consistent in layout and styling so as not to distract the user.  

#### What I learned
Maintaining styles and layouts accross many pages is quite difficult and it helps to move styles up as much as possible to prevent them from differing. One of the big issues with this site was the fact that some of the data from the http requests was deeply nested in the database and required accessing specifically yet dynamically as the request changed when chosen by the user


#### What improvements could be made
Some of the images are not perfect as they scale to screen size they begin to cut off parts of the picture that are more important, this is especially visible on the gallery section of the Parallax effect on the homepage. Using a more powerfull maps API would have given me the abillity to do more with the google maps component however it would have increase complexity massivley.
